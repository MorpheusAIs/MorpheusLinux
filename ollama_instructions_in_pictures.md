5) When the install is finished, you will see a little llama lounging in the system bar. <br>

7) You're almost done! Now we open the terminal to test the install. When you've opened the terminal app, type
   ```Ollama run orca-mini:latest```

8) This will download a small model called Orca-Mini. Later, you can scale up to a lorger model as your computer will allow.  We're just using orca-mini to test. 

If you are ever wondering if Ollama is running, open a browser and navigate to https://localhost:11434, and if it's running, you will see a message saying so.

![localhost](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/assets/76454555/1dfcfffe-2365-402a-84de-f0fc17cf3b6c)

If it's not running, you will see a "Not Found" error.  Just open terminal and enter:
```ollama serve``` 

and refresh https://localhost:11434.

Now you're ready to install Morpheus!
